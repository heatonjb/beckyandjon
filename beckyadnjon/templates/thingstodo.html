<b>In and around Angel & Highbury, Islington</b><br/>
We live in lovely, leafy Highbury in North London. There’s lots to do in the local areas of Islington and Stoke Newington, so if you have time, here are a few of our favourite things. A great way to get to know the area around our reception venue is to take a walk from Angel tube station up Upper Street via Camden Passage. Head north away from the tube station, veering right and you’ll find yourself on a pedestrianised street called Camden Passage. Stop for a cup of the best coffee in the area at Coffee Works Project, then continue northwards past the numerous antique stalls. At the end of the passage you’ll emerge back on the main road (Essex Road). Cross at the crossing and if it’s a nice day the small triangular park Islington Green is a nice place to sit for a bit. Otherwise continue past Waterstones on your right up Upper Street, and turn right onto it. Upper Street is full of interesting boutiques, nice restaurants and a great cinema ‘Screen on the Green’ (we’ll ignore the countless estate agents!). From here you can walk about a mile northwards up to Highbury & Islington tube station, taking a detour off onto Canonbury Square to visit the art collection at the  Estorick Collection. If, after all that, you want to sit and relax and the weather’s nice, Highbury Fields just past the large traffic island park at Highbury Corner is a lovely park to hang out in.<br/><br/>

Islington has tonnes of great restaurants with cuisine from around the world. Our favourite has to be Trullo at Highbury Corner for delicious Italian food (moderately priced). For Latin American food Sabor on Essex Road is great, for Korean Busan at Highbury Corner, and to experience Afghan food the Afghan Kitchen on Islington Green is a must. Upper Street has door-to-door restaurants: despite being a chain Masala Zone is good for modern Indian food, Isaarn for Thai, Porchetta for Pizza, Gallipoli (or Galliopoli Again a few doors up) for Turkish, and the famous Ottolenghi for great vegetarian fare. The first gastropub in the UK is in Islington (The Eagle), so it would be only fitting to check out a few local hostelries. A few of our favourites include The Marquess Tavern, the Island Queen, the Charles Lamb, the Duke of Cambridge and the Lamb on Holloway Road.

<b>Further afield</b><br/>
Of course there’s more to London than Islington, much much more! <br/><br/>

Timeout is a great resource of all things London, from art galleries to musicals, cinemas to museums, restaurants and bars.  It’s also great for finding out about one-off things going on that week. One highlight for design lovers is the London Design Festival that’s happening the week immediately before our wedding and over that weekend. <br/><br/>

For shoppers we recommend Oxford Street and Regent Street for the big stores (Selfridges, Fewicks, Liberty) and the most choice, around Carnaby Street and Kingly Court for a break from the big stores and some great boutiques, and Covent Garden for a more relaxed experience with a bustling atmosphere. If you’re more into vintage and new designers then head east to Spitalfields, Brick Lane and Shoreditch. Of course if you don’t mind large shopping centres and want to catch a glimpse of the Olympic Park, Westfield Stratford City is easily reached from central London (the Overground train from Highbury takes about 15 minutes direct).<br/><br/>

One of our favourite places just to hang out and people watch is down on the Southbank on the terrace of the Royal Festival Hall. To get a great feel of London take a walk from the London Eye along the south bank, passing the Royal Festival Hall, Hayward Gallery, BFI, National Theatre, ITV studios, Gabriels Wharf, Oxo Tower, Tate Modern, Shakespeares Globe, the Golden Hinde, Southwark Cathedral, Borough Market (Saturdays only), More London, City Hall, Tower Bridge, Shad Thames and eventually, the Design Museum. To do the whole walk takes about 1-2 hours.<br/><br/>

To see some lesser known parts of London take a trip to see the yachts at St Katharine’s Docks, or take the new cable car over the Thames, get a great view of the city from Hampstead Heath, or climb the Monument. St Pancras International station isn’t just somewhere to pass through but is a destination in its own right – sip champagne on the platform bar, stare up at the amazing roof,  and then wander round the newly developed area behind the station that’s now home to Central St Martins College of Art and the German Gymnasium.<br/><br/>

<b>For people with kids</b><br/>
London caters really well for children with numerous free museums, galleries, large parks and activities just for children. A great area to visit  if you have kids is the Brunswick Centre, Coram’s Fields and Lambs Conduit Street in Bloomsbury. Lambs Conduit Street is full of lovely small boutiques and cafes, but at the end of the street is a big park, complete with sheep and chickens, that you’re only allowed in if you have children with you! Next door the Brunswick Centre has all the usual chains, but is a nice pedestrianised, open-air shopping complex where you can sit outside and look at the fountains. If it’s warm Somerset House on the river is a great place to take kids and let them run around – the courtyard is full of dancing fountains which kids are actively encouraged to play in. Remember a spare change of clothes though! <br/><br/>



We could write an entire guidebook on London, but instead we’ve recruited Jon’s sister Katherine to answer your questions, give tips and recommendations for things to do, how to get around, places to eat and where to shop. In another life she would have been a tour guide or travel agent, so ask away! Email <a href="mailto:kheaton@gmail.com">kheaton@gmail.com</a><br/>
